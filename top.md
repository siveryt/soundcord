# Soundcord

## The simple Soundboard for discord.

### Features:

- Send your own sounds
- Submit your sounds to our sound library
- Over 200 Sounds in our library
- Type correction
- Open Source

### How to Use

If sound cord is new to your Server, please type `*setup` to set the bot initially up. You can use `*sound` or `*-` and a sound after that to play a sound in the channel, you're currently connected to. Just like this: `*sound meow`. You can ping someone at the end to play a sound in his/her channel. You don't have to be connected to a channel. Example: `*sound rickroll @Sivery`. Commands that play sounds can only be used in server channel and can't be executed inside DMs. After the Bot registered the command your message will be deleted. So the channel is kept clean and tidy. If you attach a MP3 file which isn't longer than 10 seconds this will be played instead of a default sound. You can get a list of all sounds with `*sounds`. If you need helo just type `*help`.

### Information
